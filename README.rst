ledgerlink-contract
===================

|

Ledgerlink (or ledgr.link) is a URL shortener service that uses the NEO blockchain as a mean to
store irreplaceable short URLs. Such shortened URLs are protected against any third party
interference because they cannot be changed by anybody - they will live forever on the NEO
blockchain. Thus the NEO blockchain is used as a source of trust, ensuring that the shortened links
always lead to where they are supposed to.
